# Event object

## 1. Introduction

In javascript we can listen the object event to retrieve information and work with it.

```js
addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```

> **Note:** In Angular and other frameworks orientated to component development this is not needed, since they have their particular syntax.
