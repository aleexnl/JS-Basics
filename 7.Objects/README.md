# JavaScript Objects

## 1. Introduction

Objects are data structures that represent properties, values and actions that the object can do. All objects have properties or attributes and behavior or actions represented with `key : value`

```js
const laptop = {
  screenSize: 13,
  model: "MacBook Pro",
};
```
