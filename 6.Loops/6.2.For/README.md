# JavaScript for loop

## 1. Introduction

This is a determited loop, since we know how many times will execute the code.

- It's composed just by 3 parts:
  - Initialization of the variable
  - Number of laps
  - Variable increase or decrease

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  //code to execute
}
```

> **Note:** It's not recommended to create infinite loops, because they can collapse the explorer and the users computer.
