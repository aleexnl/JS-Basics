# JavaScript While and Do while loop

## 1. While Loop

This is an undetermited loop, since we don't know how many times will execute the code.

- It's composed just by a exit condition.
- If the condition is not meet, the code will not be executed.

```js
while (/*Condition*/) {
  //code to execute
}
```

> **Note:** It's not recommended to create infinite loops, because they can collapse the explorer and the users computer.

## 2. Do while Loop

This is an undetermited loop, since we don't know how many times will execute the code.

- It's composed by the code to execute and the exit condition.
- The difference between `while` and `do while` loops is that at least the `do while` loop will be executed at least one time.

```js
do {
  //code to execute
} while (/*Condition*/);
```

> **Note:** It's not recommended to create infinite loops, because they can collapse the explorer and the users computer.
