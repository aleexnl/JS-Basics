# JavaScript Loops

## 1. Introduction

Loops are used when we have a part of code that repeats a counted or uncounted number of times. We have determinted loops and undetermined loops.

## 2. Determined loops

They are used when we know how many times the code will be repeated. An example would be a code that prints the number 1 to number 100.

## 3. Undetermined

They are used when we do not know how many times the code will be repeated. An example would be a code that show a message to the user whenever they are trying to type a password.
Since we don not know whow many times will the user try to input the password, we need to make sure that the loop is working untill the user types it.

## 4. Structure

```js
loop {
    // code here
}
```
