This is a Javascript related repository.
It is mainly focused on documenting javascript basics, so we all can have a _"simple cheatsheet"_ in any moment.

> These files are made by me for me, I share them so that they can be reviewed, improved and so that I and others can learn. There is no reason to take everything I have written on this project as a definitive guide or something as the only inspiration to learn JavaScript
